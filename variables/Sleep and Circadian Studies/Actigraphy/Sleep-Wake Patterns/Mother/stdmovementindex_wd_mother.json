  "description": "Sleep Fragmentation is an index of restlessness during the sleep period expressed as a percentage. [Kristen L et al. 2011 (PubMed ID:21411507)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3114508/)<br><br>There are three type of measures for sleep fragmentation: movement Index (MI), fragmentation index (FI), and total sleep fragmentation Index. The fragmentation index refers to the percentage of 60s periods of sleep out of the total number of periods of immobility. The movement index refers to the total of scored awake minutes divided by sleep period (i.e. total time in bed). The total sleep fragmentation index is the sum of FI and MI. [ActiGraph validation reference](https://actigraphcorp.force.com/support/s/article/Sleep-Fragmentation-Index-Validation-Reference)<br><br>Missing if the number of main sleep <= 1<br><br>The actigraphy data was collected on the non-dominant wrist via a tri-axis solid state accelerometer on the ActiGraph wGT3X-BTÂ® Activity Monitor, sampled at 100 Hz and consolidated into 60-second epochs. Missing data due to non-wear was excluded, with days considered valid if the device was worn for 10 or more hours not during sleep. After manually defined the rest intervals guided by the sleep diary, the ActiLife software applied an automatic scoring algorithm (Cole-Kripke algorithm) to classify each 60-second epoch within that interval as either \"sleep\" or \"wake\". Non-wear was detected by participant self-report in the sleep diary, and visual inspection of the data by trained scorers.",
